Break the implementation plan into small, self-contained parts.

Working directory: {working_dir}

Steps:
1. Read "{plans_dir}/plan.md"
2. Explore the codebase as needed
3. Write each part as a separate markdown file in {detail_plans_dir}/ (named 01_<slug>.md, 02_<slug>.md, etc.)
4. Write {detail_plans_dir}/TODO.md

IMPORTANT: The TODO.md must use the flat RED/GREEN/REFACTOR format specified in your instructions. Do NOT use hierarchical grouping.
