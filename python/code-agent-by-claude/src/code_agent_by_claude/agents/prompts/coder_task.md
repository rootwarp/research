Implement code by iterating through the TODO checklist.

Working directory: {working_dir}

Follow this cycle:
1. Read "{detail_plans_dir}/TODO.md"
2. Find the first unchecked item
3. Read the matching detail plan
4. Implement the changes
5. Run tests and fix failures
6. Mark the item done in TODO.md
7. Repeat until all items done

After all items are complete, provide a summary of what was done.
